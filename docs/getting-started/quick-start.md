# Quick Start
Embark on your Squig journey! This quick start guide is your express ticket to diving into Squig and coding swiftly with ease.

## 1. Installation

Start by downloading and installing Squig on your machine. Follow the steps outlined in the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for your operating system.

## 2. Hello, World!

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" program to familiarize yourself with Squig.

1. **Create a New File:**
   Open your text editor and create a new file. Save it with a ".squig" extension (e.g., `hello.squig`).

2. **Write Your Squig Code:**
   In your `hello.squig` file, enter the following code:

   ```squig
   # hello.squig
   
   log "Hello, World!"
   ```

3. **Run Your Squig Program:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `hello.squig` file. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   squig hello.squig
   ```

   You should see the output:

   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

## 3. Explore and Experiment

Now that you've successfully run your first Squig program, it's time to explore more features. Check out the [Documentation](/docs/intro) for detailed information on Squig's syntax, features, and examples.
