The Squig project is organized into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the language implementation. Here's an overview of the project structure:

- `Lexer.py`: Module for tokenizing source code.
- `Parser.py`: Module for parsing tokenized code into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- `Interpreter.py`: Module for interpreting the AST and executing Squig code.
- `Token.py`: Module defining token types used by the lexer.
- `Types.py`: Module defining Squig data types and type checking logic.
- `Node.py`: Module defining nodes used in the AST representation.
- `Error.py`: Module defining error types and handling logic.
- `Position.py`: Module defining position tracking for error reporting.

## Contributing Guidelines

Before contributing to Squig, please read our [Contributing Guidelines](link-to-contributing-guidelines). These guidelines outline the process for submitting bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up your development environment for Squig, follow the steps outlined in the [Development Environment Setup Guide](link-to-dev-environment-setup-guide). This guide covers setting up dependencies, installing development tools, and configuring your environment for Squig development.

## Module Overview

### Lexer

The `Lexer` module is responsible for tokenizing Squig source code. It processes input text and generates a stream of tokens representing the individual components of the code.

### Parser

The `Parser` module parses tokenized code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It analyzes the structure of the code and constructs a hierarchical representation that captures its syntactic relationships.

### Interpreter

The `Interpreter` module interprets the AST generated by the parser and executes Squig code. It traverses the AST and performs the necessary actions to execute each statement and expression in the code.

### Token

The `Token` module defines the token types used by the lexer. It includes classes for representing different types of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators.

### Types

The `Types` module defines Squig data types and provides type checking functionality. It includes classes and functions for representing and manipulating data types in Squig programs.

### Node

The `Node` module defines the node types used in the AST representation. It includes classes for representing various syntactic constructs, such as statements, expressions, and declarations.

### Error

The `Error` module defines error types and provides error handling functionality. It includes classes for representing different types of errors encountered during lexing, parsing, and interpretation.

### Position

The `Position` module defines position tracking functionality for error reporting. It includes classes for representing positions within the source code and calculating line and column numbers.
